# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

Welcome to my learning project on Data Structures in Python! As I explore data structures, I'm documenting my journey by coding them from scratch. This repository serves as a personal educational tool and a resource for others starting their journey in data structures and algorithms.

What's Inside
Currently, the repository includes basic implementations of the following data structures:

- Arrays
- LinkedLists
- Stacks
- Queues
- HashSet
- HashMap

I plan to expand this list as I learn more data structures and algorithms.
